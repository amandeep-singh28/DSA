(i)Internal Node
Node which is not leaf node and not root node

(ii)Ancestor Node
Suppose the path is 3-4-2-1, than the ancestor for node 3 will be 4, 2 and 1

(iii)Descendant Node
Node 2 Descendant
Every child below node 2 will be Descendant of node 2.

(iv)Edges -> Number of nodes  - 1

(v)Height
In the form of edges and nodes.

(vi)Sub-Tree
->Left Sub Tree
->Right Sub Tree

****Important Properties of Trees****
(i)Taversing in a tree is done by DFS and BFS algorithm.
(ii)It has no loop and no circuit.
(iii)It has no self-loop.

****Types Of Trees*
(i)Generic Trees
1 Root and n children
Each node can have any number of child nodes

(ii)Binary Trees
Each node can have atmost 2 child nodes.(not more than 2)
Root -> Left Child and Right Child

(iii)Binary Search Trees
Each node can have atmost 2 child nodes.(not more than 2)
Root -> Left Child and Right Child.
It has every node to the left of a node is smaller and every node to the right has a greater value.
For every node the nodes for the left sub tree will be smaller and vice versa.

(iv)AVL Tree
Balanced search tree.
