****Hashing****
Arbitary sized key -> Small Key(Hashed Key) with the help of some hash functions
For example:- 9876589 -> 17 (Hashed Key)
It gives hashed key for strings also

****Properties****
(i)For every same input we get the same output everytime.
(ii)A perfect hash function always produces unique key for unique output.
    Non-perfect hash function -> It means that it is giving same output for two or more inputs{Collision}

****Working****
(i)Every KEY is passed to some hash functions to generate hashed key.
(ii)According to the hashed key, <key,value> pairs are stored in the hash table.

****Types of Hash Functions****
(i)Division Method
(ii)Mid Square Method
(iii)Digit Folding Method
(iv)Multiplication Method

****Collision****
There is a chance, that for some key hash function can result in same hashed value. This is known as collision.
But the hash table which we were making it is of ARRAY OF NODES <KEY,VALUE>, so if a hashed value is repeated than we will not be able to store it because at one hashed value we can only store one value.

****Collision Resolution Techniques****
(i)Chaining(Open Hashing)
(ii)Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)
    (a)Linear Probing
    (b)Quadratic Probing
    (c)Double Hashing

****Open Hashing****
Now in this case we create hashtable on the basis of ARRAY OF LINKED LIST OF NODES. So if a hashed value is repeated than it is linked to that key at that hashed value.

****Problem in Open Hashing****
Traversal problem -> Time Complexity O(n)
If we want to find an element, we have to traverse through the linked list.

****Solution****
Load Factor concept -> In this we double the hash table size to solve the problem of the time complexity. We want minimum collision and maintain constant time complexity.
By default the load factor is 75% of capacity.
Suppose the capacity is 100 -> It means that we can easily insert the elements till 0.75, after that we have to double the size of the hashtable to avoid collision and to get constant time complexity.


****Linear Probing Working****
Instead of putting the elements in the linked list manner, we put the collision element at the next available index.
H(k) + i % M
where i -> Number of attempts
